<ul>
<li> 

If you receive compilation errors along the lines of “Package ifpdf Error: Name clash, \ifpdf is already defined” then please add a new line “\let\ifpdf\relax” right after the “\documentclass[journal]{vgtc}” call. Note that your error is due to packages you use that define “\ifpdf” which is obsolete (the result is that \ifpdf is defined twice); these packages should be changed to use ifpdf package instead.
</li>
<li> 

Note that each author’s affiliations have to be provided in the author footer on the bottom-left corner of the first page. It is permitted to merge two or more people from the same institution as long as they are shown in the same order as in the overall author sequence on the top of the first page. For example, if authors A, B, C, and D are from institutions 1, 2, 1, and 2, respectively, then it is ok to use 2 bullets as follows:


<ul>
<li> 

A and C are with Institution 1. E-mail: {a <span class="ltx_Math math v1">\(|\)</span> c}@i1.com .
</li>
<li> 

B and D are with Institution 2. E-mail: {b <span class="ltx_Math math v1">\(|\)</span> d}@i2.org .
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 

The style uses the hyperref package, thus turns references into internal links. We thus recommend to make use of the “\autoref{reference}” call (instead of “Figure~<span class='au-ref raw v1'>\ref{reference}</span>” or similar) since “\autoref{reference}” turns the entire reference into an internal link, not just the number. Examples: LABEL:fig:sample and LABEL:tab:vis_papers.
</li>
<li> 

The style automatically looks for image files with the correct extension (eps for regular LaTeX; pdf, png, and jpg for pdfLaTeX), in a set of given subfolders (figures/, pictures/, images/). It is thus sufficient to use “\includegraphics{CypressView}” (instead of “\includegraphics{pictures/CypressView.jpg}”).
</li>
<li> 

For adding hyperlinks and DOIs to the list of references, you can use “\bibliographystyle{abbrv-doi-hyperref-narrow}” (instead of “\bibliographystyle{abbrv}”). It uses the doi and url fields in a bibTeX entry and turns the entire reference into a link, giving priority to the doi. The doi can be entered with or without the “http://dx.doi.org/” url part. See the examples in the bibTeX file and the bibliography at the end of this template.
<br>
<b>Note 1:</b> occasionally (for some LaTeX distributions) this hyper-linked bibTeX style may lead to <b>compilation errors</b> (“pdfendlink ended up in different nesting level ...”) if a reference entry is broken across two pages (due to a bug in hyperref). In this case make sure you have the latest version of the hyperref package (i. e., update your LaTeX installation/packages) or, alternatively, revert back to “\bibliographystyle{abbrv-doi-narrow}” (at the expense of removing hyperlinks from the bibliography) and try “\bibliographystyle{abbrv-doi-hyperref-narrow}” again after some more editing.
<br>
<b>Note 2:</b> the “-narrow” versions of the bibliography style use the font “PTSansNarrow-TLF” for typesetting the DOIs in a compact way. This font needs to be available on your LaTeX system. It is part of the “paratype” package, and many distributions (such as MikTeX) have it automatically installed. If you do not have this package yet and want to use a “-narrow” bibliography style then use your LaTeX system’s package installer to add it. If this is not possible you can also revert to the respective bibliography styles without the “-narrow” in the file name.
<br>
DVI-based processes to compile the template apparently cannot handle the different font so, by default, the template file uses the abbrv-doi bibliography style but the compiled PDF shows you the effect of the abbrv-doi-hyperref-narrow style.
